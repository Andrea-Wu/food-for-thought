IMPLEMENTATION




Test User Info:
My name is Yon Yonson,
I live in Wisconsin.
I work in a lumber yard there.
The people I meet as
I walk down the street,
They say "Hello!"
I say "Hello!"
They say "What's your name."
I say: My name is Yon Yonson...


my fucking debugging log:
WTFORMS
    -note that wtforms and flask_wtf behave extremely differently. 
    -I didn't realize that the csrf token had to be called form.csrf_token, not form.csrf
    -flask wtforms has a debugging log: this will be useful for future things
    what is causing validators to break?
        -submit button has to be a SubmitField button in forms.py?
        -MUST use forms.validate_on_submit(), not forms.validate() && request == POST
            -option2 fixed it, but not sure if option1 makes a difference. test later. 
IS_AUTHENTICATED
    -flask_login expects the user's primary key to be called "id".
    -it should be called "id" in User.py, so that the UserMixin can use it properly
    -not sure if it needs to be called "id" in models.py.
LOGIN_REQUIRED
    -the login_required decorator must be used after the app.route decorator
USER
    -there is no point of storing the password in user.py
    -load_user has to return a legit User object. (flask documentation was abstraction)
REQUEST.args
    -are different than the arguments passed to a function
JAVASCRIPT INTEGRATION
    -the "onload" function should be an attribute of the "body" tag. Can't be attached to JUST ANY old tag
