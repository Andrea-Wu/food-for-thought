Test User Info:
My name is Yon Yonson,
I live in Wisconsin.
I work in a lumber yard there.
The people I meet as
I walk down the street,
They say "Hello!"
I say "Hello!"
They say "What's your name."
I say: My name is Yon Yonson...


my fucking debugging log:
    -I didn't realize that the csrf token had to be called form.csrf_token, not form.csrf
    -flask wtforms has a debugging log: this will be useful for future things
    what is causing validators to break?
        -submit button has to be a SubmitField button in forms.py?
        -MUST use forms.validate_on_submit(), not forms.validate() && request == POST
            -option2 fixed it, but not sure if option1 makes a difference. test later.
